<!-- 

--script snipets go after the body, before the last html tag
-- you can separate it so have the script templates in a different html file and import it using 
<link href = "link" rel="import">

--handlebars.js library: we can load the template and it allows us to define the templates using only html and then we can just replace the variables 

in handlebars, index is not accessed using '[i]' but you would just do '.i'

how to know which attribute is using data prefix attributes. allows us to pass arguments to the element

event delegation -- idea that i listen for events on a parent element so if someone clicked anywhere in any of the child elements, the handler responsible for these events is this event delegation

for the quiz, create the event delegation because you cant give the events to each individual elements


I CHANGED THE SCRIPT NAMES TO GIVE THEM THE QUESTION TYPE AND ADDED THAT ATTRIUBTE TO THE JSON AS WELL
